PROJECT
• Predict the similarity between two groups of unstructured sentences

METHODOLOGY
• Utilized Python Word2vec library to transform words into vectors and calculate Cosine, Jaccard and Manhaton distances. Utilized Python fuzzywuzzy library to obtain fuzzywuzzy ratio
• Combined basic features (word length, character length) with the distances and ratio to form the feature pool, then trained XGBoost model to give the prediction through k-fold cross validation

RESULT
• Achieved 82% accuracy rate (Top 10%) in predicting the level of similarity between two groups of sentences

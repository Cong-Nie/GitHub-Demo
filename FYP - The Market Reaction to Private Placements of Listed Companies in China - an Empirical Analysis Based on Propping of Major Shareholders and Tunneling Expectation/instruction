THESIS:
• The market response to private placements of a company may include both the supportive attitude towards large shareholder
  and the possible expectation of benefit transfer

DATA:
• 1451 targeted private placement samples from January 2016 to January 2019 in China A Share's Market

METHODOLOGY:
• The event research method is used to test the change of excess return rate during the private placement window
• The two-step multiple regression is used to build the support model of large shareholders

CONCLUSION:
• There is a 9% positive market effect on private placements - 
  Investor sentiment proxy variable has a significant positive impact on the market reaction
• After excluding market irrational factors measured by the relative turnover rate of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets
  The market reaction can be divided into two parts:
  (1) Propping proxy variables respond positively to the market
  (2) Tunneling proxy variables have a significant negative impact on the market response
  Among them, the support effect can explain 25% of the cumulative abnormal return fluctuations,
              the tunneling expectation can explain the 2.67% return fluctuations
• Private placement discount is positively related to the support effect of major shareholders,
  while the issuance ratio/scale, and large shareholder subscription are positively correlated with tunneling expectation
• In the cases of asset-oriented private placements, the market's expectation of tunneling occurrence is more significant

RESULT:
• Awarded "Undergraduate Excellent Academic Paper" with a score 96/100 (Top 1%)
